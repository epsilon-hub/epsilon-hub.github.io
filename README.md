## What we need to use to make this repository built and published with GitHub Pages

We should use **STATIC **page generator because GitHub Pages doesn't provide database.

For example:

* Jekyll
* Hexo
* Gatsby
* ...

There's no need for you to know anything about HTML because they are easy to build. You can change the default config by editing YAML files provided.

But if you want a more personalized page you may need some knowledge on CSS. You can study them by searching Google.
